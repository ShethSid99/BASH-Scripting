#In this Bash script, following are the steps taken to reach to desired output. 
#Step #1: In order to obtain IP and location data, we are calling a given API. If there is already cached copy present, we are utilizing it rather than making a call to API.- L#12 to L#25
#Step #2: The next step is to parse IP and location file obtained in step #1 to get details of Latitiude and Longitude. - L#26 to L#36
#Step #3: We have created one key seperately than this script. In this step, Latitiude and Longitude details obtained in Step #2 and generated key is passed to weatherbit service to obtain weather forecast details for last 16 days in JSON file. - L#37 to L#40
#Step #4: In order to get day wise temperature details (high & low), we are parsing JSON file and stroing day wise data in output file. - L#41 to L#45
#Step #5: In fina step, we are printing output file on the console. - L#46 to L#48
#Note: Printing each intemediate step on the console is stopped and we are only displaying output in asked format. In case of debugging, please uncomment echo commands to troubleshoot.
